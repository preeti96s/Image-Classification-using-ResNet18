# Image-Classification-using-ResNet18
Performing image classification using transfer learning

• Using an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-18 model to extract deep features for the given images. Evaluating image classification accuracy using k-NN classifier using these features. Extracting the features from the last/second-last fully connected layer.

• Fine tuning: Replacing the ImageNet trained classifier in ResNet-18 with a new classifier for the given dataset.

• Creating a simple network from scratch and training using the same set of classes with cross-entropy loss.
